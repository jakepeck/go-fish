    <h5>How To Play:</h5>
    <h2>Game Objective:</h2>
    <h3>The goal is to win the most "books" of cards. A book is any four of a kind, such as four kings, four aces, and so on.</h3>
    <h2>Dealing Rules</h2>
    <h3>While in most versions of Go-Fish, the dealer is selected at random or by an initial card draw, this version of Go-Fish
      will always start play with the player going first.
    </h3>
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <h3>The player first chooses to "fish" from any of the other players at the table, and then requests a card in their hand from that opponent.
      The player who is "fishing â€œmust have at least one card of the rank that was asked for in their hand. The player who is addressed must hand over all the cards requested. 
      If the player has none, they say, "Go fish!" and the player who made the request draws the top card of the stock and places it in their hand.
      If a player successfully fishes a card from an opponent, or receives the card they asked for when drawing, they get to go again. 
      The player can ask for the same card or a different one. So long as the player succeeds in getting cards (makes a catch), their turn continues.  
      If a player gets the fourth card of a book, the player shows all four cards, places them on the table face up in front of everyone, and plays again.
      If the player goes fishing without "making a catch" (does not receive a card he asked for), the turn passes to the left.
      The game ends when all thirteen books have been won. The winner is the player with the most books. During the game, if a player is left without cards, they may (when it's their turn to play), draw from the stock and then ask for cards of that rank. If there are no cards left in the stock, they are out of the game.</h3>
