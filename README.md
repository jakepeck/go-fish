## Description
___
For my project, I aimed to create an implementation of one of my favorite childhood games "Go-Fish" using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In this game, I utilized event listeners to direct the gameplay, and a handful of data structures and functions to represent the players, the cards, and the gameplay itself.

## Future Plans 
___
In the future, I aim to flesh out the game a bit more. Potentially by rebuilding the game from its core so that I can add in animations. By focusing more on user experience, much of the infrastructure I created in this program can be simplified so that it can be used more easily with animations and timeout functions. 

Additionally, I would like to create more advanced AI and specifically an evil AI that only targets the player when fishing.

- First off, I'd like to thank the creators of Flexbox and Grid! You can find their documentation here: [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) | [Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) 
- Additionally, for all card stacking I used the following resource. This is an incredible tool that I think anyone who wants to dynamically create elements for grid should check out: [CSS Tricks for Stacking Divs](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-stack-elements-in-css/)
