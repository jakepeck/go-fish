## Description
___
For my project, I aimed to create an implementation of one of my favorite childhood games "Go-Fish" using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In this game, I utilized event listeners to direct the gameplay, and a handful of data structures and functions to represent the players, the cards, and the gameplay itself. 

You can see my Trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/FUjQtT9q/project-1-go-fish).

## Future Plans 
___
In the future, I aim to flesh out the game a bit more. Potentially by rebuilding the game from its core so that I can add in animations. By focusing more on user experience, much of the infrastructure I created in this program can be simplified so that it can be used more easily with animations and timeout functions. 

Additionally, I would like to create more advanced AI and specifically an evil AI that only targets the player when fishing.
